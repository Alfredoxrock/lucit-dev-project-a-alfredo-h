# lucit-dev-project-a-alfredo-h

## Project Overview

The Lucit Application delivers advertising images in real-time to digital billboards. Each time one of the images is displayed on a digital billboard screen, that system delivers a “pingback” to our system notifying us that the image was displayed.

You may login to the Lucit App to get an idea of what some of these images look like. You have been given access to “Demo” accounts within Lucit that you are free to play around with.

Your project is to build an application that simply shows the last image that was played on a digital billboard, when and where it played. This application will be an internal application that we will run on screens / TV’s inside of our office so we can see, in real-time, the most recent image that we ran.
